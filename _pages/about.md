Welcome! My name is Bill (Shi Biao) and I am an assistant professor of Marketing at Southern Connecticut State University.
From this website, you can see my publication and working papers, teaching (past and current), as well as educational background and current service at Southern. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach me: dings1 (at) southernCT.edu. You can also visit [my statistics Github page](https://williamdingpullman.github.io/).

Regarding research, one stream of my research studies the role of value and belief in shaping consumer decision making. Another research topic is about how consumers spend money in close relationships (e.g., gift-giving). You can read more about my research by clicking [here](https://billsding.github.io/publications/). 

I have taught Marketing Research, Consumer Behavior, and International Business at WSU. In Fall 2020, I am teaching Marketing Research and Consumer Behavior at Southern. You can read more about my teaching by clicking [here](https://billsding.github.io/teaching/).
